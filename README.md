#Drowsiness Detection System for Drivers

#This project implements a drowsiness detection system using machine learning to enhance driver safety and prevent accidents caused by drowsy driving. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to scan the driver's iris and analyze eye movement patterns in real-time. By monitoring the state of the driver's eyes, the system can detect signs of drowsiness such as eyelid drooping and prolonged eye closure. When drowsiness is detected, the system triggers a series of alerts, including audible beeps and visual notifications, to prompt the driver to wake up and remain alert. This proactive approach aims to mitigate the risks associated with driver fatigue and reduce the likelihood of accidents on the road. The system's accuracy and responsiveness make it a valuable tool for promoting safer driving practices and improving overall road safety.
